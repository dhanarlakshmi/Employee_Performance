# Employee Performance Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end Employee Performance Analysis** solution built using  
**Python, SQL, and Power BI**.

The objective of this project is to analyze employee performance, attrition patterns, and
key HR metrics to support data-driven decision-making.  
The solution covers the complete analytics lifecycle — from raw data processing to
interactive dashboard visualization.
